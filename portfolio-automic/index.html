      <p class="portfolio-text">
        Porting a desktop-based business process automation software, which grew over 20 years, to the web. The user experience has to be improved, so that more users want to use the new user interface instead of the old one. 
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="portfolio-section">Solution / Overview</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">
        New guidelines had and still have to be created, in order to make the system consistent and easy to work with for designers with different skill levels. User experience methods are included in the design and engineering process. Designers receive specific trainings on UX methods and are encouraged to use them in their daily business.

      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Contextual Inquiry</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        The objectives are to get to know the user, see how they use our current system, what their requirements are, how their work environment looks, implement personas and share the gathered knowledge with colleagues.
        This is achieved by visiting customers, watching typical work activities and record data via notes, audio and video if it is allowed – do not forget the NDA.
        During the observations questions are asked to help understand what the person is doing and why.

      <hr class="portfolio-section-heading-spacer">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Survey and Interview</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Customer insight surveys are sent out to get to know the users personality, work environment and skill levels. Based on the gathered data personas are implemented. Surveys and interviews are also used throughout usability tests and contextual inquiries to understand the actions of the user and to ease the analysis of the result afterwards.
      </p>

      <hr class="portfolio-section-heading-spacer">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Persona</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Personas are used and generated to build up empathy, narrow the focus, develop a common understanding, share research results and ease decision making. 
        Data is gathered through user insight surveys, interviews, contextual inquiries and customer journey maps. This data is analysed, a personas template is generated and specific personas are implemented.

      </p>

      <hr class="portfolio-section-heading-spacer">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Customer Journey Map</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        The objectives are to understand the experience flow of the users and to address requirements and critical points, which have to be improved / considered.
        Around eight participants (four per group) from different departments identify stages of the customer journey, and analyse goals, thoughts, actions, touch points, pain points and needs for each stage. This is done by putting sticky notes on the journey and describing the thoughts behind it. At the end participants rate the determined pain points, so that the most critical ones can be tackled first.

      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Design Studio</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        This is a collaborative method to generate a solid design idea and a common understanding about the problem space in a short period of time. Up to five people from different departments meet in a prepared setup and bring in different views and ideas. 
        At the beginning the moderator / initiator of the design studio frames the problem. For this purpose a problem statement, personas and scenarios are defined. 
        After the problem definition the participants have ten minutes by themselves to sketch six ideas without talking. They are encouraged to try out unconventional concepts allowing new and innovative ideas to flourish.
        The sketches are presented to the colleagues who provide feedback and constructive criticism.
        In the next iteration each person creates one concept, on their own, which could also be based on a peer’s idea and present it after ten minutes. 
        In the last step, the participants produce a final design, which takes into account all suggestions.

      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Wireframe</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Wireframes help to evaluate general layouts and flows and are used for reviews with other designers and developers. They can also assist to point out open questions, things which have to be thought of or to see if it is technical feasible.
      </p>

      <hr class="portfolio-section-heading-spacer">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Mockup</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Mockups are generated for final specifications, which get implemented by the development teams and for design guidelines. 
      </p>

      <hr class="portfolio-section-heading-spacer">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Prototyping and Usability Test</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Prototypes about specific topics are built to see, if the it fits the users’ needs, and if it is easy and intuitive to interact with.
        These are tested with real customers or in-house with colleagues - with and without experience with the product. Usability test are also conducted for rough concepts (e.g. low fidelity prototypes, wireframes) and current implementations. 
        For usability tests tasks are defined and designed, online surveys are created and the test software is prepared to capture video and audio to ease the analysis afterwards. 
        Based on the results of the usability tests prototypes are refined for iterations, new guidelines are written or current implementations are reworked.

      <p class="portfolio-text">
        The XXXLutz Group has a strong appearance with its brick and mortar shops, this also needs to be ported to the online image. Therefore the website needs to be improved and problems have to be identified. 
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="portfolio-section">Solution / Overview</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">
        A new and innovative design is rolled out to all brands and countries. Analysis of data, customer research and improvements on the websites are our constant companions. In order to solve the right problems I introduce design thinking methods in the day to day business and combe quantitative with qualitative methods.

      <h2 class="portfolio-section">Process and Methods</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">
        Depending on the specific problem at hand, different UX methods are used. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Interviews</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Interviews are used for various topics. One example is the following: We conducted 202 in person interviews in various stores to find out why customers visit our stores and what their story is. Additionally we wanted to find out more about their expectations, how happy they are with their visit and how we could improve. 
        Based on the results we enhanced the demographical data of our customers with the newly gathered information. Furthermore, we found out that most of our customers visit a store with very concrete goal in mind and are in a later stage in the customer journey.

      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">UX & Crowd Tests</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        A combination of crowd and UX tests are conducted in order to find the biggest improvement potential and how easy the interaction with our website is for our users. The recruiting of the customers is done by us. We launch a campaign on the website and send out a screener to pick the most appropriate users. 
        The analysis of both is combined and presented to the whole digital department in order to spread the knowledge and insights of our customers.

      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Journey Mapping</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Journey mapping is used as a communication and collaboration tool to get a better understanding of the flow of a certain interaction in a bigger journey. It helps to create a common understanding for all members involved in the process. The team identifies stages of the customer journey and analyses goals, thoughts, actions, touch points, pain points and needs for each stage.

    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Data Analysis</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        In order to make more informed decisions we use data from analytics and mouseflow. This gives us insights about our users, their flow, where we should start looking closer and if we are on the right path.
        The usage of quantitative data enables us also to act fast on conversion drops, quickly prove / disprove theories and persuade stakeholders who are data-oriented.

    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Survey</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Multiple surveys are sent out to collect NPS data and insight information about our customers. We also sent surveys to our support or shop employees to find out more about problems and flows of various services we offer. 
        These surveys give us a deeper understanding of our customers and their needs as well as their journey and problems with our services.

    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Style Guide</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        The style guide is created to demonstrate the look and feel of components and how they should be used. It acts as a communication tool with our developers, marketing and product management. We also created a Sketch library in order to make it easier to stay consistent and to work faster. 
        There are different style guides for different brands so that the image of the brands stays consistent within the shops, for print media and the online appearance.

      <h3 class="portfolio-subsection">Designs & Flows</h3>
      <p class="portfolio-process-text">
        Designs and flows are created and are used for the communication with the team as well as the hand over artefacts for the development team. 
        In order to stay consistent and learn from other UX designers we meet regularly for our reviews and discuss our thoughts with team as well as other departments.
